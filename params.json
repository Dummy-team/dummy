{"name":"Dummy","tagline":"A light Sass & coffee base front-end","body":"# Dummy\r\n\r\nA light Sass &amp; Coffee front-end base\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this \"framework\" is to provide a consistent file structure with a normalized code and a collection of helpers and resets\r\n\r\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/Inouit/dummy?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=body_badge)\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n\r\n## A Sass & coffee base\r\n- A light column system (Deprecated, it will be rewritten into a more modern grid system)\r\n- A simple font sizing : 1.6em = 16px\r\n- A collection of variables to manage default sizing, fonts and colors\r\n- A slice & content max width management\r\n- Some jQuery plugins helpers ready to use\r\n\r\n## Grunt to make your life easier\r\n\r\n- Compiles your `*.scss` files\r\n- Prefixes your css\r\n- Compiles your CoffeeScript files\r\n- Serves your files\r\n- Lint your files:\r\n  - [Scss](https://github.com/Inouit/dummy/blob/master/grunt/.scss-lint.yml)\r\n  - [CoffeeScript](https://github.com/Inouit/dummy/blob/master/grunt/coffeelint.json)\r\n- Synchronizes and reloads your modifications across browsers (many images added at once may cause performance issues)\r\n- [SassDoc](http://sassdoc.com/annotations/) friendly\r\n- ([Codo](https://github.com/coffeedoc/codo)) friendly\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n  First, ensure that you have the latest [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](http://npmjs.org/) installed. [scss-lint](https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint#requirements) requires a gem from ruby.\r\n\r\n  Test that Grunt's CLI is installed by running `grunt --version`.  If the command isn't found, run `npm install -g grunt-cli`.  For more information about installing Grunt, see the [getting started guide](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Plug and play\r\n### Plug\r\n1. Download [latest release](https://github.com/Inouit/dummy/releases)\r\n- Go to the `grunt` subfolder\r\n- Run `npm install` to install all dependencies\r\n installed\r\n- To build `css` and`js` run `grunt build`\r\n\r\n### Play\r\n1. Edit [`browserSync.coffee`](https://github.com/Inouit/dummy/blob/master/grunt/tasks/options/browserSync.coffee) task to your need.\r\n- To start working and serving files run `grunt` inside `grunt` folder\r\n- Browser-sync will prompt the server url (`localhost:3000`)\r\n- You can now edit `*.scss` & `*.coffee` files, `*.css`and `*.js` will be overwritten\r\n\r\n## Customize tasks\r\nThe grunt tasks and file structure should work in most use cases. You may still need to do some changes, from file location to new grunt tasks.  \r\n\r\n### Source folders\r\n  You can change source and destination folders in the config object of the [`gruntfile.coffee`](https://github.com/Inouit/dummy/blob/master/grunt/gruntfile.coffee#L30)\r\n\r\n### Add grunt tasks\r\n  We use a module based structure for our grunt tasks, so it should be easy to edit any existing task. All task configurations stored in the [options folder](https://github.com/Inouit/dummy/tree/master/grunt/tasks/options). are loaded in the grunt file. Grunt task alias are in the [tasks folder](https://github.com/Inouit/dummy/tree/master/grunt/tasks).\r\n\r\n  To get farther into the mind behind this, checkout [Diviser pour mieux grunter (fr)](https://medium.com/dev-notes/diviser-pour-mieux-grunter-a745f41e1a32).\r\n\r\n# Keep in touch\r\n\r\nIf find any caveats using it or have suggestions to improve the tool we gladly accept [Pull Requests](https://github.com/Inouit/dummy/tree/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-pull-request) and [issues](https://github.com/Inouit/dummy/issues).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
