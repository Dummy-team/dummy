# ![Dummy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dummy-team/dummy/gh-pages/img/dummy.png)

## Solid foundations for modern development
_Sass, javascript & automation_

The purpose of the dummy is to provide a consistent file structure with a normalized code and a collection of helpers and resets ([_Components served separately_](https://github.com/dummy-team/dummy-toolkit)). It wraps [ITCSS](http://itcss.io/) principles with a powerful automation system.

# Features

## A Sass & Javascript base
- It follows [ITCSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OKZOV-iLj4) concepts
- A simple font sizing : 1.6em = 16px
- A collection of variables to manage default sizing, fonts and colors

## Gulp to make your life easier
Check out our [memo](https://github.com/dummy-team/dummy/tree/gh-pages/img/memo/)!  
- Compiles your `*.scss` files
- Prefixes your css
- Bundles your Javascript files with [browserify](http://browserify.org/) and [Babeljs](http://babeljs.io)
- Serves your files
- Synchronizes and reloads your modifications across browsers (many images added at once may cause performance issues)

# Usage
  First, ensure that you have the latest [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](http://npmjs.org/) installed.
